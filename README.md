### This project appears to be a job portal website called "WorkHive". The website has a navbar with a brand name and navigation options such as statistics, applied jobs, and blog.

* The homepage of the website includes a banner, a category list section, and a featured job section. The category list section has four cards with the category logo, category name, and the number of available jobs in that category. The featured job section displays the first four job cards that include the job title, company name, remote or onsite status, location, full-time or part-time status, salary, view details button, and apply now button. There is also a see all jobs button at the bottom of these cards.

* When the user clicks on the view details button, they will be redirected to the job details page with a banner and all the job details such as company logo, job title, company name, remote or onsite status, location, full-time or part-time status, salary, job description, job responsibility, educational requirements, experiences, and contact information.

* The user can also apply for a job by clicking the apply now button, which will add that job information to the local storage of the user's browser.

* There is also an applied jobs page that shows all the applied jobs in a tabular/list view. The page includes a banner at the top.

* The website also has a statistics page that includes a chart based on the assignment marks against the assignment number. The chart includes tooltips.

* Finally, the website includes a 404 page that appears when the user navigates to a non-existing page. Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly job portal website with useful features and functionalities.
